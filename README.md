Modified PS4 ISO files to simplify launching the BD-JB exploit â€” aiming for an all-in-one auto jailbreak + GoldHEN ISO solution.

PS4 BD-JB Auto Jailbreak ISO (All-in-One)
This project provides modified Blu-ray ISO files designed to launch the PS4 jailbreak as simply and reliably as possible. Based on the BD-JB exploit method, these ISOs aim to:

Automatically trigger the BD-JB exploit on compatible PS4 firmware versions.

Optionally load HEN (Homebrew Enabler) or other payloads.

Eventually serve as an all-in-one jailbreak ISO solution, similar to the PS5 ISOs we have currently.

Goal:
Automatically load the lapse kernel exploit up to PS4 system version 12.02 and launch GoldHEN
